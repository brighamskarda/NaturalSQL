    A There are 4 spiders in the database.
2.  Q Excluding centipedes and millipedes, what is the average number of legs each animal has in the database?
    A The average number of legs for animals in the database, excluding centipedes and millipedes, is 5.2.
3.  Q On average do spiders with necrotic or neurotoxic venom weigh more?
    A On average, spiders with neurotoxic venom weigh more, with an average weight of 0.535, compared to spiders with necrotic venom, which have an average weight of 0.38.
4.  Q What percentage of animals in this database have wings?
    A Approximately 16.67% of the animals in this database have wings.
    E This answer is not correct. There are multiple ways to interpret this question, but even the most conservative approach should show at least 25% of the animals as having wings. The SQL generated was gibberish. SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT a.id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) 
5.  Q What percentage of insects in this database have wings?
    A 50.0% of the insects in this database have wings.
6.  Q What is the average weight of insects who fly?
    A The average weight of insects that fly is approximately 0.019.
    E This answer is incorrect. It just took the average weight of all the insects instead of inferring that only insects with wings can fly.
7.  Q 
    A ```sql
    SELECT
        (SELECT AVG(a.weight)
        FROM Animal a
        JOIN Bird b ON a.id = b.animal_id
        WHERE b.nest_type = 'rock') AS rock_avg_weight,
        (SELECT AVG(a.weight)
        FROM Animal a
        JOIN Bird b ON a.id = b.animal_id
        WHERE b.nest_type != 'rock') AS other_avg_weight;
    ```
    E It appears that sometimes the API I'm using doesn't give back a plain SQl response. There is probably a configuration for that somewhere.
8.  Q What is the heaviest bird?
